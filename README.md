# Trajectory-tracking-using-Craziflie-2.0
This repo contains the implementation of sliding mode robust control with boundary layer for trajectory tracking using a Craziflie 2.0 MAV. <br />
This project was completed as a part of WPI course RBE502: Robot Control along with my project partner Abizer Patanwala.
As the programming scripts and some additional material are subject to copyright policy of WPI for the course RBE502: Robot Control under the guidance of Prof. Farzan, the repository only contains project report and output video, images.
